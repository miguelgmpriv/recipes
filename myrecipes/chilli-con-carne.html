    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy and delicious chilli con carne for any skill level</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>800g crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>14oz kidney beans</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2- 1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute, then add capsicum and cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as you go, until mostly browned.</li>
        <li>Add Chili Spice Mix. Cook until beef is browned all over. (This step helps release extra flavour from the spices)</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients, with 1/2 cup of water for Quick Cook or 1 1/2 cups for Slow Cook. Bring to simmer, then adjust heat per step below:</li>
        <li>Quick Cook - 20 to 40 minutes, uncovered, on medium low heat so it's bubbling gently; OR</li>
        <li>Slow Cook - 1.5 hours to 2 hours, covered, on low heat so it's bubbling very gently. (Note 3 Slow Cooker)</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste just before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, or ladle into bowls and serve with corn chips or warm tortillas on the side with Toppings of choice (Note 6). See Note 7 for more serving options. My usual: Either over rice or with corn chips, always with sour cream, cheese and coriander.</li>
    </ol>
